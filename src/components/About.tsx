    <h1>About Luke</h1>
    <p>Hi there, Iâ€™m a front-end engineer and user interface designer. I get my kicks from creating web experiences that magically wrestle complexity into delightful simplicity. <strong>But really I just love making great tools for people so they can work smarter.</strong></p>
    <p>My voracious appetite for learning and building along with an MS in Human-Computer Interaction has given me an eclectic background that touches the whole user-centered design lifecycle. Currently I work at the University of Chicago Law School where we build custom web applications for faculty, students, and staff when off-the-shelf solutions don't quite fit our needs. My favorite tools these days are React / Redux, TypeScript, and Laravel.</p>
